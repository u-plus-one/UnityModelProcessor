# UnityModelProcessor

Provides an asset post processor that is aimed towards fixing various issues related to importing blender models:
- Fixes axis orientation related issues with blender models (No more 89.98 degree rotations)
- Option to flip the Z axis to avoid models that are roatated by 180 degrees
- Option to fix insanely high light intensities generated by blender files

WIP: Ability to apply user-defined postprocessing rules on the model (e.g: automatically making a child a collider-only object)
